title: Learning Fast
---

I watched a YouTube video titled, "Making badass developers", which was a recording of an O'Reilly conference speach given by Kathy Sierra. In it, she explained that the best way to master something is to learn it using high quality and very high quantity (hundreds) of examples.

I'm going to give this a shot. For the last few months, I've been using and trying to learn Linux, while also reading books on Python, Monitoring, 
Network Automation, Raspberry Pi, and so much more. I've also watched dozens of videos on YT, while spending time on Github, Hacker News, 
and any other source if information I can absorb about the many areas I am interested in expanding my IT expertise. Unfortunately, I 
haven't made as much progress as I would like, thus I am going to try Kathy's recommendation to learn Linux to get to the expert level.

I bought The Linux Bible recently, so I'll be following along the chapters rather closely. I'll apply Kathy's approach by creating dozens, 
if not hundreds of practical examples for me to recreate the examples covered in the book. I'll also be chronicalling my supplimental examples
and progress in this blog. Oh - I'm practicing this on an Ubuntu 19.10 system, if you want to follow along.
