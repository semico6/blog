## Command-line completion
**Command, alias, or function:** If the text you type begins with regular characters, the shell tries to complete the text with a command, alias, or function name.
**Variable:** If the text you type begins with a dollar sign ($), the shell completes the text with a variable from the current shell.
**Username:** If the text you type begins with a tilde (~), the shell completes the text with a username. As a result, *~username* indicates the home directory of the named user.
**Hostname:** If the text you type begins with the at symbol (@), the shell completes the text with a hostname taken from the */etc/hosts* file.
